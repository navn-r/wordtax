# MPAC WordTax

In a recent round of negotiations with the Government of Ontario, MPAC has established a new system for the valuation of properties, **WordTax**!. Residents of Ontario will now be taxed based on whether they can guess the word of the day. The word of the day is a randomly generated word, and if the resident can guess it, they will be exempt from paying property taxes for the year.

The rules are simple:

- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word
- You have 6 tries to guess the word correctly
- Input your guess using your keyboard and press the **Enter** key to submit

If you fail to guess the word, **you will have to pay the WordTax!**
